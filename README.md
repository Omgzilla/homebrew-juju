# Juju | DevOps management tool

Homebrew only supports the latest version which is ideal for me.
This repo points at the latest 2.9.51 version.

_This is my first attempt to create a homebrew formula._

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install omgzilla/homebrew-juju/juju`

## Documentation

[Juju](https://juju.is/)

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
